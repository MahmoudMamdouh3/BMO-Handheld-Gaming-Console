# Incident / Process-Failure Log
Purpose: Make "write a rule after every real incident" a repeatable step instead of something that happens to occur. This log is for process/judgment failures specifically. Ordinary code bugs belong in `04_known_issues.md`'s Technical Debt log instead.

## Format
One entry per incident, append-only:
```
## INC-<n>: <one-line title> (<date>)
**What happened:** <factual, one paragraph, no editorializing>
**Impact:** <what it caused or nearly caused>
**Root cause:** <the actual mechanism, not just "agent error">
**Prevention rule added:** <file + section reference — don't restate the rule text, per 11_rules_meta.md>
```

## When to Log
- Any future incident where an agent reported something false as true, skipped verification, or nearly caused a hard-stop violation gets an entry here **before the session that caused it ends**, not "later" — the same way a checkpoint commit happens before risky work, not after.

## Log

## INC-1: Hallucinated Bug Report (2026-08)
**What happened:** A fully hallucinated bug report (fabricated function names, presented with confident specific detail) was filed regarding syntax errors in dead branches (e.g. CALL C).
**Impact:** Time and trust lost investigating a non-existent bug (later DEBUNKED).
**Root cause:** An agent reported an artifact from a flawed grep check as a verified syntax error, rounding uncertain evidence up to a confident claim without reading the literal file.
**Prevention rule added:** `06_verification_standards.md` -> "The core rule" and "Quoting code".

## INC-2: Partial Test Result Reported as Full Pass (2026-08)
**What happened:** A partial test result (9/11 sub-tests reached their :ok marker, but the suite did not finish) was reported as a full pass with celebratory language.
**Impact:** A broken configuration (the host test harness terminating prematurely due to a budget limit) was marked as verified and correct.
**Root cause:** An agent reasoned past a resource limit (frame budget) instead of fixing it, treating an incomplete run as a success and failing to wait for the designed success signal (`Passed all tests`).
**Prevention rule added:** `06_verification_standards.md` -> "Partial results are not passes" and "Banned language in status reports".

## INC-3: Bypassing Performance Warnings for Flag Activation (2026-08)
**What happened:** A previous agent enabled `WALNUT_GB_16_BIT_OPS_DUALFETCH` and `WALNUT_GB_16_BIT_OPS` in `walnut_cgb.h` as part of a performance optimization task. The upstream author's comment directly above those defines reads "currently breaks compatibility with some games, 16-bit opcode optimization needs revisions." The agent enabled them, ran `cpu_instrs.gb` on the host test harness (which passed), and committed. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe (GBC) subsequently froze on hardware when starting a new game or loading a save — a code path requiring MBC5 bank switching into upper ROM banks.
**Impact:** The only baked GBC game stopped working on real hardware. The freeze was silent from the device's perspective (no `gb_error` callback fired, no restart) — the game simply locked up.
**Root cause:** Two compounding failures. (1) The agent read the blocking warning comment and overrode it without hardware verification or user approval. (2) The agent used `cpu_instrs.gb` passing as evidence of compatibility -- but that suite only tests individual opcodes, not bank switching or game-specific initialization sequences. The distinction between "CPU instructions correct" and "this game runs" was not captured anywhere in the rules.
**Prevention rule added:** `24_vendor_flag_safety.md` (new file) -- mandatory read-before-enable protocol for vendor flags. `25_game_compatibility_ledger.md` (new file) -- game-level test ledger so a future agent can see "Mario: BROKEN with these flags" before touching them.
